Hi Everyone!

The name of this project is "ciemas". I just want to call this project something that sound similar to "cms" and here we are.

The purpose of the project is to creat a conent management system that is simple, secure and for everyone. The project is far from done yet and I intend to develop it day by day. Let's see.

My initial codes are totally based on Matt Doyle's blog post. I will try to develop it to a better one.
